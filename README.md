#  Udacity Nano Degree MyReads Project 6
The goal of this project was to utilized the starter code provided and to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in the template using the React App builder. The static code consisted of 3 shelves of books that contained a mixture of books.  Each shelf was either label "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read".  As the developer, my job was to make sure that the books on the main page had a control that allowed for selecting a specific shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. 
The search page consists of a text input box that is used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match a specific search query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.
